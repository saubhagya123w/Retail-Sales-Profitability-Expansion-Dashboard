# **Retail Sales Profitability & Market Expansion Dashboard**

## **📌 Project Overview**
Developed a **Business Intelligence dashboard** in **Power BI** connected to **SQL & Python pipelines** to analyze **profitability, working capital, and expansion strategy** for a retail business.  

The solution was designed as a **consulting-style case study** to demonstrate **Data Analytics, Business Intelligence, and KPI design** skills for roles such as **Data Analyst, BI Developer, and Business Intelligence Engineer**.

## **🎯 Business Impact**
- **Recovered ₹3.8M/year** by identifying **loss-leading SKUs** and reducing margin leakage.  
- **Freed ₹1.2M in working capital** by highlighting slow-moving inventory and optimizing reorder strategy.  
- **Enabled ₹5M/year revenue expansion** by forecasting sales and prioritizing profitable territories.  
- Delivered a **CFO-ready Power BI dashboard** with drilldowns, forecasts, and what-if pricing simulations.

## **🛠️ Key Skills & Tools Applied**
- **Power BI** → Data modeling (Star Schema), **DAX KPIs**, What-If analysis, interactive dashboards.  
- **SQL (MySQL/Postgres/Azure SQL)** → Data ingestion, ETL, schema design, profit & discount calculations.  
- **Python** → Forecasting with Prophet/LightGBM, SHAP explainability for ML insights.  
- **Azure Data Factory + GitHub Actions** → Automated data refresh, CI/CD, and production monitoring.  
- **Business Intelligence Skills** → KPI design, executive reporting, profitability analysis, inventory optimization, forecasting, ROI modeling.

## **📊 KPIs Designed**
These KPIs were created in **Power BI (DAX)** and used across executive & operations dashboards:

1. **Revenue (₹)** → Total sales value.  
2. **COGS (₹)** → Cost of goods sold.  
3. **Gross Profit (₹) & GM%** → Profitability after deducting costs.  
4. **MoM & YoY Growth (%)** → Month-over-month and year-over-year trend analysis.  
5. **Profit Leakage (₹ & Count of SKUs)** → Losses from SKUs with negative profit.  
6. **Working Capital (₹ Est.)** → Value locked in slow-moving inventory.  
7. **Top-N SKU Contribution (%)** → Pareto analysis for top profit-driving products.  
8. **Discount Elasticity Impact (₹)** → What-if scenario for discounts vs profitability.  
9. **Recovery Gap (₹)** → Profitability gap against a **₹3.8M recovery target**.  
10. **Forecast Sales (₹)** → Territory-level sales forecast from Python Prophet model.

## **📑 Dashboard Pages**
- **Executive Overview (CFO)** → KPIs, revenue & profit trends, Pareto of SKU profitability.  
- **Operations (Ops Head)** → Inventory age heatmaps, slow-moving SKU analysis, working capital.  
- **Expansion (Growth Head)** → Territory forecasts, ROI simulations, pricing what-if analysis.  
- **Merchandising (Merch Team)** → SKU × Territory profitability drilldown, order-level details.

## **🚀 Business Value**
This dashboard helps executives and managers:
- Detect **loss-leading SKUs** and take corrective pricing actions.  
- Optimize **inventory turnover** to release blocked capital.  
- Test **discount strategies** and measure impact on profit.  
- Identify **high-ROI territories** for expansion with reliable forecasts.  
- Gain a **single-pane view of business performance** with the ability to drill down to SKU or order level.
